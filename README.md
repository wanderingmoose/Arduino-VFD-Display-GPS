The laser cut case can be found under Doc's, the material was 3mm hardboard.


This is not a complete how to, but more a reminder for me on how I achieved the project.
Hope some of the informaiton here is usefull to you.

* Keep Tinkering.

* Hardware used:
* Arduino Nano
* Simple GPS from Aliexpress
* Noritake GU7003 112 x 16 VFD display
