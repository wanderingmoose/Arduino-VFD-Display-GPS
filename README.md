# Arduino Nano VFD project with GPS
Simple sketch for reading speed, direction, and alitude from GPS module. And using thermistor to get outside temperature, with a divider cct to read battery voltage.
This was built to be used in a vehicle

The laser cut case can be found under Doc's, the material was 3mm hardboard.


This is not a complete how to, but more a reminder for me on how I achieved the project.
Hope some of the informaiton here is usefull to you.
Keep Tinkering.

Hardware used:
Arduino Nano,
Simple GPS from Aliexpress,
Noritake GU7003 112 x 16 VFD display.
