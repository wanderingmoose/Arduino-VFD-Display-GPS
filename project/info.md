I just started writing my code in seperate ino to allow code to be easily used in other sketches. So please be kind and patient on the disjointed coding.
You will need all the ino's to achieve the final sketch.
I have alot of thinking and book keeping do to achieve this process. 
The only library you will have to upload for outside source is the Noritake VFD display and the link is in the main readme.md.
You can rewrite the code for a 16 x 2 LCD and ISP or I2c interface.
